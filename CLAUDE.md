# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-assisted writing style explorer focused on helping writers find and articulate description styles. The initial focus is on setting descriptions (e.g., describing locations in fiction).

## Current State

The project is in early specification phase. See `spec.md` for the product vision and planned features.

## Planned Architecture

The initial implementation should be a static HTML prototype with hard-coded data structures, designed to be converted to a full application later. Key UI components:
- Pane for describing what the user wants to describe
- Pane for user guidance on description approach
- Multiple alternative descriptions with style labels/tags/meta-descriptions

## Coding approach

- any time you add new functionality to the code, document it in spec.md if not already present.
