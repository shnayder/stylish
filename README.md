# Writing Style Explorer

AI-assisted tool that helps writers find and articulate their description style. Paste your writing context, get alternative phrasings, drill down into what you like and why, and build a personal style guide.

Uses a local LLM (via LM Studio) or the Claude API.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run serve     # starts on http://localhost:3000
npm test          # runs Playwright tests
```
